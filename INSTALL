You will need nettle (https://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/).

If you are building from a tarball and have nettle installed system wide,
building and installing should be as easy as
./configure
make
make install

If you are building from git you may need to install autotools.
On a debian or ubuntu system, please install the following packages:
libxxhash-dev nettle-dev build-essential

after that,
./bootstrap.sh && ./configure && make

should do the trick
